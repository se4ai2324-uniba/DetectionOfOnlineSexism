# DVC and MLflow Integration for Machine Learning Projects

This README provides guidance on using DVC (Data Version Control) and MLflow for managing and tracking machine learning projects. DVC is an open-source version control system for data science and machine learning projects, while MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.

## Overview

Integrating DVC and MLflow offers a robust solution for handling large datasets, versioning data & models, experiment tracking, and model deployment. DVC assists in versioning data and models, while MLflow tracks and manages the machine learning experiments and deployments.

## Features

- **Data Versioning with DVC**: Efficiently handle large datasets and version control models.
- **Experiment Tracking with MLflow**: Track experiments, log parameters, and compare results.
- **Model Deployment**: Utilize MLflow's model registry for model deployment.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure experiments are reproducible with version-controlled data and models.

## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install DVC and MLflow using pip:

```bash
pip install dvc mlflow
```

## Usage

### Setting Up DVC

1. **Initialize DVC in your Project**:
   ```bash
   dvc init
   ```

2. **Add Data to DVC**:
   Track large datasets or models with DVC:
   ```bash
   dvc add data/dataset.csv
   git add data/.gitignore data/dataset.csv.dvc
   git commit -m "Add dataset to DVC"
   ```

### Integrating MLflow

1. **Configure MLflow**:
   Set the tracking URI and specify the experiment name:
   ```bash
   mlflow set-tracking-uri ./mlruns
   mlflow create-experiment "my_experiment"
   ```

2. **Run an MLflow Experiment**:
   Utilize MLflow to log parameters, metrics, and models:
   ```python
   import mlflow

   with mlflow.start_run():
       mlflow.log_param("param_name", value)
       mlflow.log_metric("metric_name", value)
       mlflow.log_artifact("path/to/artifact")
   ```

### Combining DVC and MLflow

Use DVC to manage data and models, and MLflow for experiment tracking. For example, use DVC to pull the latest data version before running an experiment with MLflow.

```bash
dvc pull data/dataset.csv.dvc
python mlflow_experiment.py
```

## Versioning Data and Models

DVC tracks changes in your data and models. Use `dvc push` and `dvc pull` commands to synchronize your large files with remote storage, ensuring consistency across environments.

## Experiment Tracking

MLflow tracks each experiment's parameters, metrics, and output models, making it easy to compare different runs and select the best model for deployment.

## Model Deployment

Utilize MLflow's model registry for deploying models to various production environments, ensuring a smooth transition from experimentation to deployment.

## Best Practices

- Regularly commit changes in data and code to ensure reproducibility.
- Log all relevant experiment details in MLflow to facilitate analysis and comparison.
- Use DVC remotes for backing up and sharing large datasets and models.
